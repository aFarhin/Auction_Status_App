# Auction_Status_App

The "Auction Status App" is a web application that allows users to search and view auction data. 
The application fetches data from an API endpoint and allows users to search for data based on "To Location", "Status" and "Fare" using input fields.
The data is then displayed in a responsive manner with different color codes for different statuses.

The application uses modern web development technologies such as asynchronous JavaScript (async/await), the Fetch API for data retrieval, 
and CSS Flexbox for responsive design. Additionally, the application stores fetched data in session storage to reduce the number of API calls required.

Overall, the "Auction Status App" is a well-implemented application that provides a great user experience for searching and viewing auction data.
